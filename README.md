Discord bot that says random dwarven vows with the !vow command.

Originally started from a hello world tutorial, I decided to give it its own repo to keep any changes to it consolidated.

Currently using this list of Dwarven Vows, and it picks a random one to say from it with the !vow command:

		Dwarven Vow #1: Let's all work together for a peaceful world.
		Dwarven Vow #2: Never abandon someone in need.
		Dwarven Vow #4: Don't depend on others. Walk on your own two legs.
		Dwarven Vow #5: The more you add, the worse it gets.
		Dwarven Vow #7: Justice and love will always win.
		Dwarven Vow #7: Goodness and love will always win.
		Dwarven Vow #9: Fall down seven times, stand up eight.
		Dwarven Vow #10: Play hard, play often.
		Dwarven Vow #11: Lying is the first step down the path of thievery.
		Dwarven Vow #14: Even a small star shines in the darkness.
		Dwarven Vow #16: You can do anything if you try.
		Dwarven Vow #18: It's better to be deceived than to deceive.
		Dwarven Vow #24: Never let your feet run faster than your shoes.
		Dwarven Vow #32: Cross even a stone bridge after you've tested it.
		Dwarven Vow #41: It's better to begin in the evening than not at all.
		Dwarven Vow #41: Haste makes waste.
		Dwarven Vow #43: Never forget the basics.
		Dwarven Vow #55: A bad workman blames his tools.
		Dwarven Vow #108: Let sleeping dogs lie.
		Dwarven Vow #134: Compassion benefits all men.

I would like to add more functionality in the future, and make some optimizations.
